## What is ETLBox

ETLBox is a lightweight ETL (extract, transform, load) library and data integration toolbox for .NET. You can use it to read any data from different sources and connect them with customizable transformations. Finally, you can export the data into different databases, web endpoints, file types or any other destinations. While data is processed in memory, you can choose between different transformation components to harmonize, filter, aggregate, validate and clean your data.
