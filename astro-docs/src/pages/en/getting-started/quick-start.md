## What is ETLBox

ETLBox is a lightweight ETL (extract, transform, load) library and data integration toolbox for .NET. You can use it to read any data from different sources and connect them with customizable transformations. Finally, you can export the data into different databases, web endpoints, file types or any other destinations. While data is processed in memory, you can choose between different transformation components to harmonize, filter, aggregate, validate and clean your data.

ETLBox is a fully functional alternative to other ETL tools like SQLServer Integrations Services (SSIS) or Azure Data Factory. The main difference to other toolsets is that it doesn't come with a User Interface. But no worries! Working with ETLBox, you will discover that creating data flows programmatically is the best approach for solving most of your ETL and data integration related problems.
